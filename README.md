# Valorant Account Switcher:
Valorant account switcher tool for switching between Riot Games accounts.

# Software Requirements:
- This software requires the use of additional modules. If you are only downloading the .py file then you can locate which modules were used at the top of the code.

# Software Information:
- This software is a tool for switching Riot Games accounts by importing them using your username and password.
- Accounts can be imported by entering your Riot Games username and password for that specific account and also deleted if neccessary. 
- All RiotGames passwords are stored with Encryption methods and NOT stored in plain text.
- A maximum of five accounts can be imported as I am not promoting smurfing within Valorant and believe anymore than five accounts is unnecessary. 
- The software works using automation, meaning when an account is selected to load then the user must not provide any keyboard/mouse input during this timeframe.

# Installation:

The software can be downloaded from the releases section as a zip file. Once the zip file has been extracted just simply run the executable file.
